    <h1>Concussions in the NFL</h1>
    <h2>The NFL has been dedicated to lowering concussion rates but is there progress?  </h2>
    <h3>By Jacob Hunting</h3>
    <p>The National Football League in the last 20 years has owned up to its largest medical issue; the rise of concussions and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE. The NFL has rolled out different attempted solutions, everything from rule changes designed to protect quarterbacks to new helmets, but have all their efforts actually resulted in reduced concussions?</p>
    
    <h2>The Number of Concussion in Practice and Games </h2>
    <h4>Games are responsible for a majority of the concussions in the years from 2015-2022</h4>

    <h2>The Number of Concussion by Position from 2002-2007</h2>
    <h4>Rule changes meant to protect quarterbacks have been one of the major changes the NFL has made to attempt and reduce concussion but data suggests they should look at rule changes that protect other position groups mainly special teams.</h4>
